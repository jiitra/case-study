        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Background &amp; Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          My team of four members, including myself as the Project Manager and
          UI Designer, successfully finished this project in less than 10 weeks.
          Along with me, there was another Project Manager, two Coders, a UX
          Designer, and two Data Architects in our group.
        </p>
        <p>
          The design and prototype on Figma were created by students from the
          last semester&apos;s class. This semester, my team took that design
          and developed it further to create a responsive and functional working
          web prototype. We conducted three rounds of usability testing to
          enhance the user experience of the web prototype. As the UI Designer,
          I continually made edits to the Figma design and created HTML and CSS
          pages according to the Figma wireframes. Our Coders integrated PHP and
          a database, as well as microinteractions, to ensure a smooth and
          intuitive user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our ultimate goal was to develop a web application that enables users
          to order food from the Kami Food Truck using dynamic data. Together,
          we experienced the process of developing and production.
        </p>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Our aim is to enhance the previous semester&apos;s design and
          integrate PHP and database with the code. As the designer of this
          project, I had to ensure that my ideas were practical and could be
          executed within a limited time frame of fewer than 10 weeks. This
          approach helped me to design with a developer-friendly mindset.
          Furthermore, we aimed to have all essential features of the
          application fully functional by the end of the term.
        </p>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
          The objective is this project is to develop a fully operational web
          application for Kami Food Truck. The design of the final product must
          be supported by the results of usability testing, and the ordering
          process should be dynamically executed using PHP code and a database.
          Moreover, all crucial features necessary for the application&apos;s
          operation should be functional. Users should report an overall
          satisfaction with the app in order for it to be viewed as successful.
        </p>
        <h2>Starting Out: Evaluating the Critical Path</h2>
        <p>
          For this stage, we had a week to complete the critical path. In this
          stage, I collected the research findings from the previous semester
          and created a responsive layout on Figma that displayed research
          findings and design system elements. Then, this layout was built in
          HTML and CSS by the group coders. This included a moodboard, user
          personas, and app styles determined by the previous semester&apos;s
          group. Lastly, I created a low-fidelity prototype that allows the user
          to navigate through the app&apos;s critical path.
        </p>
        <h2>Alpha Build</h2>
        <div class="center">

        </div>
        <h3>Alpha: Prototyping</h3>
        <p>
          In a week, I created high-fidelity prototypes on Figma for Mobile,
          Tablet, and Desktop breakpoints. These designs were based on a
          previous mobile design, which I expanded to multiple breakpoints and
          modified according to the proposed critical path. The prototypes had
          real images and content to show Kami&apos;s menu items. For the first
          round of testing, we used the mobile alpha prototype.

        <h3>Alpha: Building the HTML &amp; CSS</h3>
        <p>
          Dividing the work betweek myself and one of the coders, we built
          screens for the full critical path in under a week. These are static,
          mobile web pages that allow the user to move through the essential
          pages. Throughout the term, we worked together on GitHub and
          corresponded about our changes to ensure that there were no conflicts.
          One challenge was cohesiveness among our files, since me and the two
          coders all worked on pages. Throughout the term we worked on unified
          styling throughout all the changes. Although the final product did not
          look exactly like the Figma design, it had the essential elements that
          were most important to the interface.
        </p>
        <h3>Alpha: Usability Testing</h3>
        <p>
          For the first round of usability testing, users navigated through the
          Figma prototype following task prompts. The UX Designer on my team
          hosted the meetings, and team members attended to take notes. The web
          app was still in its early stages, so the Figma prototype was the best
          options for users to be able to experience the full flow of the app.
          After usability testing, we reviewed the survey results and I
          determined what design changes needed to be implemented according to
          the majority of usability test participants.

        <p>
          The app opens on the menu screen, removing any possible barrier to
          entry and allowing users to start looking at the menu and deciding
          what they would like to order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users can then add any menu item to the order. On main dishes, there
          is a spice selection for users to decide how they would like it to be
          prepared.
        </p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          Ultimately, my group was able to create a fully functioning web app
          for Kami in less than 10 weeks. According to usability test results,
          users overall liked the site. Throughout this process, I learned that
          the Most Viable Product will not always be the perfect design, but
          instead the design that focuses on elements essential to the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I had more time for this project, I would make sure that the
          smaller details of the web app match the UI design on Figma. I would
          also add more branded elements, like artwork, to make the site feel
          like it truly belongs with Kami.
