        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          In this group project, I was the UI Designer and Project Manager in a
          team that built a web app for Kami Food Truck. Within 10 weeks, I
          designed wireframes and built HTML and CSS pages for the
          website&apos;s interface. I also helped conduct 3 rounds of usability
          testing and adapted the design along the way. My final deliverable was
          a fully responsive web page with design choices shaped by the previous
          rounds of usability testing.

        <p>
          We're called Imperfect Roll because we were brought together by chance
          - a roll of the dice, metaphorically. Plus, we all like to play games,
          tabletop and video games alike.
        </p>
        <p>
          My team of four members, including myself as the Project Manager and
          UI Designer, successfully finished this project in less than 10 weeks.
          Along with me, there was another Project Manager, two Coders, a UX
          Designer, and two Data Architects in our group. As the UI designer, I
          worked on designing the Figma file, and creating and updating the HTML
          and CSS web pages.
        </p>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          The design and prototype on Figma were created by students from the
          last semester&apos;s class. This semester, my team took that design
          and developed it further to create a responsive and functional working
          web prototype. Along with the UX Designer, I conducted three rounds of
          usability testing to enhance the user experience of the web prototype.
          As the UI Designer, I continually made edits to the Figma design and
          created HTML and CSS pages according to the Figma wireframes. Our
          Coders integrated PHP and a database, as well as microinteractions, to
          ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our ultimate goal was to develop a web application that enables users
          to order food from the Kami Food Truck using dynamic data. Together,
          we experienced the process of developing and production, accomplishing
          our goal through iterations and teamwork.
        </p>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Our aim is to enhance the previous semester&apos;s design and
          integrate PHP and database with the code. As the designer of this
          project, I had to ensure that my ideas were practical and could be
          executed within a limited time frame of fewer than 10 weeks. This
          approach helped me to design with a developer-friendly mindset.
          Furthermore, we aimed to have all essential features of the
          application fully functional by the end of the term.
        </p>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
          The objective is this project is to develop a fully operational web
          application for Kami Food Truck. The design of the final product must
          be supported by the results of usability testing, and the ordering
          process should be dynamically executed using PHP code and a database.
          Moreover, all crucial features necessary for the application&apos;s
          operation should be functional. Users should report an overall
          satisfaction with the app in order for it to be viewed as successful.
        </p>
        <h2>Starting Out: Evaluating the Critical Path</h2>
        <p>
          For this stage, we had a week to complete the critical path. In this
          stage, I collected the research findings from the previous semester
          and created a responsive layout on Figma that displayed research
          findings and design system elements. Then, this layout was built in
          HTML and CSS by the group coders. This included a moodboard, user
          personas, and app styles determined by the previous semester&apos;s
          group. Lastly, I created a low-fidelity prototype that allows the user
          to navigate through the app&apos;s critical path.
        </p>
        <h2>Alpha Build</h2>
        <div class="center">
          <img src="mobile-alpha.png" />
        </div>
        <h3>Alpha: Prototyping</h3>
        <p>
          In a week, I created high-fidelity prototypes on Figma for Mobile,
          Tablet, and Desktop breakpoints. These designs were based on a
          previous mobile design, which I expanded to multiple breakpoints and
          modified according to the proposed critical path. The prototypes had
          real images and content to show Kami&apos;s menu items. For the first
          round of testing, we used the mobile alpha prototype.
        </p>

        </a>
        <h3>Alpha: Building the HTML &amp; CSS</h3>
        <p>
          Dividing the work betweek myself and one of the coders, we built
          screens for the full critical path in under a week. These are static,
          mobile web pages that allow the user to move through the essential
          pages. Throughout the term, we worked together on GitHub and
          corresponded about our changes to ensure that there were no conflicts.
          One challenge was cohesiveness among our files, since me and the two
          coders all worked on pages. Throughout the term we worked on unified
          styling throughout all the changes. Although the final product did not
          look exactly like the Figma design, it had the essential elements that
          were most important to the interface.
        </p>
        <h3>Alpha: Usability Testing</h3>
        <p>
          For the first round of usability testing, users navigated through the
          Figma prototype following task prompts. The UX Designer on my team
          hosted the meetings, and team members attended to take notes. The web
          app was still in its early stages, so the Figma prototype was the best
          options for users to be able to experience the full flow of the app.
          After usability testing, we reviewed the survey results and I
          determined what design changes needed to be implemented according to
          the majority of usability test participants.
        </p>
        <h2>Beta Build</h2>
        <div class="center">
          <img src="beta.png" />
        </div>
        <h3>Beta: Design Changes</h3>
        <p>
          For the beta build, we did the same three-step process that was
          documented in the alpha build. I started by reviewing the feedback
          from the alpha and making design changes on Figma.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two of the biggest changes were the order confirmation screen and the
          checkout screen. These screens were the ones that users were
          struggling to use the most, so it was a priority to change these
          screens. In both these screens, I strengthened the visual grouping of
          elements by using containers. I also strengthened the text hierarchy
          by changing text positioning and size.
        </p>

        <div class="center">
          <img src="order-confirm.png" />
        </div>
        <p>Alpha (left) and beta (right).</p>
        <h3>Beta: Usability Testing</h3>
        <p>
          After making the Figma changes, I implemented them into the site using
          HTML and CSS. For this round of usability testing, we allowed users to
          complete usability testing with the site instead of a Figma prototype.
          I found that users had frustrations with the site being incomplete and
          not having polished interactions. Instead of focusing on the taskflow,
          users were concerned with incomplete features. If I were to do this
          process again, I would delay beta testing so that the site could be
          more polished.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the beta stage of the site, users were overall satisfied with
          the app. When users were asked how comfortable they would be using the
          app, on a scale of 1-5, 66% of users gave it a rating of 5. In other
          words, 66% of users were completely comfortable with using the app.
        </p>

        <h2>Final Build</h2>
        <div class="center">
          <img style="margin-bottom: 2rem" src="final.png" />
        </div>
        <a href="https://durandoangiulo.com/idm216/final/" target="_blank"
          >View the final build here!
        </a>
        <p>
          The final build is responsive for any screen size, and has full
          interactivity so the user can select any menu items to complete their
          order. I added the responsiveness to the web app, and the app did not
          undergo any serious design changes because users were satisfied with
          the design in previous rounds of testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app opens on the menu screen, removing any possible barrier to
          entry and allowing users to start looking at the menu and deciding
          what they would like to order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users can then add any menu item to the order. On main dishes, there
          is a spice selection for users to decide how they would like it to be
          prepared.
        </p>
        <p>
          The navigation bar is at the bottom of the screen and has 3 items.
          This minimalist approach to information architecture allows users to
          access necessary tabs without being overwhelmed by choices.
        </p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <div class="center">
          <img class="rounded" src="graph.png" />
        </div>
        <p>
          This graph shows how 6 usability testing participants rated their
          satisfaction with the design. The rating is on a scale of 1-5, with 5
          being most satisfied. According to these results, users are
          predominantly satisfied with the app overall.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, my group was able to create a web app for Kami in less
          than 10 weeks. According to usability test results, users overall
          liked the site&apos;s visual design. Throughout all stages of testing,
          users said their favorite part of the app was the interface.
          Throughout this process, I learned that the Most Viable Product will
          not always be the perfect design, but instead the design that focuses
          on elements essential to the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I had more time for this project, I would make sure that the
          smaller details of the web app match the UI design on Figma. I would
          also add more branded elements, like artwork, to make the site feel
          like it truly belongs with Kami. Additionally, I would spend more time
          on the responsive design to eliminate white space on larger screen
          sizes. Although I was not able to perfect the smaller details for the
          final project, users still appreciated the design and thought the
          interface was sleek and streamlined.
